# Brain-tumor-classification
## Summary 
Brain tumors, which affect both children and adults, are highly aggressive diseases, constituting the majority of primary Central Nervous System (CNS) tumors. Annually, approximately 11,700 individuals are diagnosed with brain tumors, with a 5-year survival rate of around 34% for men and 36% for women. These tumors are categorized as benign, malignant, pituitary, and others. To enhance patient life expectancy, it is imperative to employ precise diagnostics and treatment planning. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the preferred method for brain tumor detection, generating substantial image data that must be evaluated by radiologists. Manual examination can be prone to errors due to the intricacies of brain tumors.  
  
The application of automated classification techniques, including Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), consistently outperforms manual classification. Therefore, proposing a system that utilizes Deep Learning Algorithms like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Transfer Learning (TL) could greatly assist medical professionals worldwide.  
  
In a context where brain tumors exhibit diverse sizes and locations, making their nature challenging to understand, MRI analysis typically necessitates a skilled neurosurgeon. Developing countries often face a shortage of qualified doctors and limited knowledge about tumors, resulting in time-consuming and challenging MRI report generation. Hence, implementing an automated system can address these challenges.  

## Tools
In the make of this studies the following tools were used:  
- Python v3.11
- Numpy
- Matplolib
- Pytorch
- Tqdm

## Analysis, model and classification
Further exploratory data analysis will be made. But, besides that, the use of transfer learning was made to employ a pretrained model of the EfficientNet and train it for this especific task.  

## Conclusion
Overall Accuracy: 0.96+  
Further metrics will be implemented.
